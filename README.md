--Ionic Assignment by Patrick Griffin G00314635--
**********************************************************

This application is used for keeping track of how many calories the user hate throughout the day.

The user enters the amount of calories for meal-1, meal-2, meal-3 amd any other food eaten throughout the day.

The most common foods are also listed in the application.

The user can switch between tabs of the listed food and calorie counter

I used javascript to do the maths of the calorie counter

The table I used has a border of 1px(pixel) and is solid red with two different columns of -Foods--Calories-

I used the ionic website to find a contrasted button of class== --button button-calm-- 

for the grid i added and extra 2 colums to conserve space 

I color coded the grid of foods and calories to make it easier for the user to read each different type of foods

Each page from the tabs is coded within the ionic-tab and the user can pass form the calorie counter back and forth to the calori listed foods. 



HOW IT WORKS..
user looks up teh amount of caories consumed and inputs them into meal1,meal2 etc

**The user must enter the amount of calories directly below the question**


The calorie counter is operated where the user enters their amount of calories in html.

the info is then passed into the maths of the javascript
var x = +y + +z + +m + +f; --This is the final line of code, I had to add the + infront of the letters y, z, m, f as now only numbers can be displayed.

If they werent there, letters will appear in the answer box.  

I added an if else state with a windows.alert to show the user the amount of calories taken that day...
It shows if the user has taken over the recommended daily amount

I used stackOverflow, w3schools and ionic framework website
